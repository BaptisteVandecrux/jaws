# About

JAWS is a scientiﬁc software workﬂow to ingest Level 2 (L2) data in the multiple 
formats now distributed, harmonize it into a common format, and deliver value-added 
Level 3 (L3) output suitable for distribution by the network operator, analysis by 
the researcher, and curation by the data center. 
NASA has funded JAWS 
([project summary](http://dust.ess.uci.edu/prp/prp_aist/prp_aist_smr.pdf)) 
from 20171001 to 20190930.

Automated Weather Station (AWS) and AWS-like networks are the primary source 
of surface-level meteorological data in remote polar regions. 
These networks have developed organically and independently, and deliver data to 
researchers in idiosyncratic ASCII formats that hinder automated processing and 
intercomparison among networks. Moreover, station tilt causes signiﬁcant biases in 
polar AWS measurements of radiation and wind direction. Researchers, network operators, 
and data centers would beneﬁt from AWS-like data in a common format, amenable to 
automated analysis, and adjusted for known biases.

The immediate target recipient elements are polar AWS network managers, users, and 
data distributors. L2 borehole data suffers from similar interoperability issues, 
as does non-polar AWS data. Hence our L3 format will be extensible to global AWS and 
permafrost networks. JAWS will increase in situ data accessibility and utility, and 
enable new derived products.
