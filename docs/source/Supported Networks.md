# Supported Networks

The current version of *JAWS* can translate L2 ASCII data from the following AWS networks to netCDF format: 

1) [**AAWS**](https://amrc.ssec.wisc.edu/)(*Antarctic Automatic Weather Stations*): They focus on observational 
Antarctic meteorological research, providing real-time and archived meteorological data and observations.

2) [**GCNet**](http://cires1.colorado.edu/steffen/gcnet/)(*Greenland Climate Network*): They collect climate information 
on Greenland's ice sheet.

3) [**IMAU**](http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/iceclimate/aws/)(*Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research*): They 
have deployed several AWS on glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets, since 1994. These AWS are deployed on different glaciers 
around the world, in different climate regimes.

4) [**POLENET**](http://polenet.org/)(*The Polar Earth Observing Network*): It is a global network dedicated to observing 
the polar regions in a changing world.

5) [**PROMICE**](http://www.promice.org/home.html)(*Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet*): 

6) [**SCAR**](https://legacy.bas.ac.uk/met/jds/met/SCAR_oma.htm)(*Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research*): It is an 
inter-disciplinary committee of the International Science Council (ISC), and was created in 1958. SCAR is charged with 
initiating, developing and coordinating high quality international scientific research in the Antarctic region.

***Note***:
If your network is not in the above list and you would like it to be supported by JAWS, please open an issue on 
[Github](https://github.com/jaws/jaws/issues) or contact *Charlie Zender* at <zender@uci.edu>


**Total number of stations handled by JAWS: 378**

**Total number of station-years of data handled by JAWS: 3600**
