### JAWS consists of:

#### 1) Standardization

Convert L2 data (usually ASCII tables) into a netCDF-based L3 format compliant with metadata conventions (Climate-Forecast and ACDD) that promote automated discovery and analysis. 

#### 2) Adjustment

Include value-added L3 features like the Retrospective, Iterative, Geometry-Based (RIGB) tilt angle and direction corrections, solar zenith angle, standardized quality flags, GPS-derived ice velocity, and turbulent fluxes.

#### 3) API

Provide a scriptable API to extend the initial L2-to-L3 conversion to newer AWS-like networks and instruments.
