# Analysis

Currently, the **input file** for analysis should be in **netCDF format**. So, first the raw ASCII files should be converted to 
netCDF using previous steps. We are working to make it accept ASCII files as input.

In the following examples we have used GCNet station at Summit, if you are using a separate network, you need to change 
the variable name accordingly.

JAWS has ability to analyse the data in multiple ways such as:

#### Diurnal

JAWS can be used to plot monthly diurnal cycle to see hourly changes for any variable throughout the month. 
The user needs to provide input file path, variable name (on which analysis needs to be done) and 
analysis type (i.e. diurnal, monthly, annual or seasonal). The argument for analysis is `-a, --anl or --analysis` and
variable name is `-v, --var or --variable`.

We will take two examples here:

* ***Case 1***: The input file contains only 1-day data. We will consider the file converted previously i.e.
 [GCNet_Summit_20120817.nc](http://jaws.ess.uci.edu/jaws/sample_data/converted/GCNet_Summit_20120817.nc)

    Use the following command to see how ***temperature*** varies throughout the day:
    ```
    $ jaws -a diurnal -v ta_tc1 GCNet_Summit_20120817.nc
    ```

* ***Case 2***: We will be using multi-year data from GCNet-Summit. We don't have permission to host this data.

    Since, there are many years and months in this file, we need to provide for which year and month 
    we want to do the analysis. The argument for year is `-y, --anl_yr or --analysis_year` and 
    month is `-m, --anl_mth or --analysis_month`.
 
    If the input file contains data for only single year, then the user doesn't  need to provide the '-y' argument. 
    Similar is the case for '-m' (month) argument.

    We will do the analysis for May-2002 at GCNet_Summit:
    ```
    $ jaws -a diurnal -v ta_tc1 -y 2002 -m 5 gcnet_summit.nc
    ```

    The blue error bar shows standard deviation for that hour across the month.

```
Important: This same file from Case 2 will be used for next three analysis because we need at-least monthly, yearly and 
multi-yearly data respectively for them.
```

#### Monthly

In this analysis, we can analyze avg, max and min values for each day of a month for any variable

This time we will do it for ***temperature*** from different sensor for Feb-2013 as following:

```
$ jaws --anl monthly --var ta_cs1 --anl_yr 2013 --anl_mth 2 gcnet_summit.nc
```

#### Annual

To plot an annual cycle with daily mean, max and min:

```
$ jaws --analysis annual --variable ta_tc1 --analysis_year 2016 gcnet_summit.nc
```

Note: Since it is annual plot, user shouldn't provide the '-m' argument

#### Seasonal

Climatological seasonal cycle showing variation for each month through multiple years:

```
$ jaws -a seasonal -v ta_tc1 gcnet_summit.nc
```

Note: Since it is seasonal plot, user shouldn't provide both '-y', '-m' argument.
