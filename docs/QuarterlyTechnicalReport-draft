Automated Weather Station and AWS-like networks deliver data in 
idiosyncratic ASCII formats that hinder automated processing and 
intercomparison among networks. Moreover, station tilt causes 
significant biases in polar AWS measurements of radiation and wind direction. 
Our JAWS project addresses these needs by developing a scientific
software workflow called “Justified AWS” (JAWS) to ingest Level 2 (L2)
data in the multiple formats now distributed, harmonize it into 
a common format, and deliver value-added Level 3 (L3) output 
suitable for distribution by the network operator, analysis by 
the researcher, and curation by the data center. 
The JAWS homepage is https://github.com/jaws.

From 20170701--20171031 our JAWS project was primarily in the
organization and recruitment phase. SE Ajay Saini joined the 
project on 20171001. PD Wenshan Wang successfully defended 
her PhD thesis on 20171113. Her thesis on the radiative causes 
of accelerated Greenland melt involved the analysis of SLD albedo, 
water vapor, and cloud fields from MODIS, MISR, and MERRA.

Version 0.1 has been launched on 20171023 which includes the 
original scripts by PD which she developed while conducting 
her thesis research,which synthesizes all available AWS networks 
in Greenland to estimate cloud radiative effects on Greenland melt.
SE has been working on writing Python scripts to standarize and 
convert AWS networks to netCDF format.

The releases completed the first Milestone (M1) of our updated Schedule 
and Milestone plan approved by NASA. Technical achievements of these releases 
include designing the command-line tool jaws to convert in situ AWS-like data from 
L2 (ASCII tables, netCDF) to L3 for PROMICE and GCNET networks. 
Work is under progress for IMAU, AAWS, Zackenberg networks.

Our aims, consistent with this project, are to increase in situ data accessibility 
and utility, and enable new derived products, in netCDF format with CF
conventions.
